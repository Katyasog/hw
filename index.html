    <h1><strong>On programming</strong></h1>
    <p>
    <h2>Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out,
        is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top of these rules tend to become
        complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you
        might just get lost in it.
    </h2>
    <h2>There will be times when reading this book feels terribly frustrating. If you are new to programming, there will
        be a lot of new material to digest. Much of this material will then be <span><em>combined</em></span> in ways
        that require you to make
        additional connections.
    </h2>
    <h2>It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling to follow the book, do not jump to any
        conclusions about your own capabilities. You are fine—you just need to keep at it. Take a break, reread some
        material, and make sure you read and understand the example programs and exercises. Learning is hard work, but
        everything you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier.

    <h2>A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a programmer, it is the directing force that makes the
        computer do what it does, it is data in the computer’s memory, yet it controls the actions performed on this
        same memory. Analogies that try to compare programs to objects we are familiar with tend to fall short. A
        superficially fitting one is that of a machine—lots of separate parts tend to be involved, and to make the whole
        thing tick, we have to consider the ways in which these parts interconnect and contribute to the operation of
        the whole.
    </h2>
    <h2>A computer is a physical machine that acts as a host for these immaterial machines. Computers themselves can do
        only stupidly straightforward things. The reason they are so useful is that they do these things at an
        incredibly high speed. A program can ingeniously combine an enormous number of these simple actions to do very
        complicated things.
    </h2>
    <h2>A program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, it is weightless, and it grows easily under our
        typing hands.
    </h2>
    <h2>But without care, a program’s size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the person who
        created it. Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming. When a program works, it is
        beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued—made
        simple in its complexity.
    </h2>
    <h2>Some programmers believe that this complexity is best managed by using only a small set of well-understood
      techniques in their programs. They have composed strict rules (“best practices”) prescribing the form programs
        should have and carefully stay within their safe little zone.
    </h2>
    <h2>
        <p class="text">
            This is not only boring, it is ineffective. New problems often require new solutions. The field of
            programming
            is young and still developing rapidly, and it is varied enough to have room for wildly different approaches.
            There are many terrible mistakes to make in program design, and you should go ahead and make them so that
            you
            understand them. A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list
            of
            rules.
